###### _A non-violent [Minetest](http://www.minetest.net/) subgame_
---
## Preface
**funTasia BloX World** (this minetest subgame world module pack) was created for children who love to invent and create funTastic things rather than slay their pals or clean up their playgrounds.

[Minetest](http://www.minetest.net/) is a block game primarly inspired by [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/de-de/). It is highly customizable by user scripts called mods. These mods are written in LUA script language and would be executed by an embedded [LUA](https://www.lua.org/) environment.

From the beginning of our childhood construction toys are present. They are considered as useful to train creativity and to learn how to abide rules. There are thousands of products out there - common toys and gaming software. Children start playing with new technologies at an increasingly early age. They explore the behavior of computer or smartphone apps and games intuitively without the ability to read. They are reliant on an intuitive and simple usablility. This would be arrived by a - non-cluttered - suitable iconograpy, speech output and simple design instructions.  
Most of gaming software imply some violent characteristics. For example, the player have to kill some non-playing characters (NPC) to get the chance to a specific game item or in-game animals must be slaughtered for food by players themself.  
So children not only have to stress on the creative construction site, even more they must direct their focus to destructive details - at most in a matter of violence. Here *funTasia BloX World* comes into play.

Players in *funTasia BloX World* only have to focus on their
* social behavior in peer group 
* own creative skills

Players in *funTasia BloX World* are prevented from
* destruct 'living environment' for subsistence
* fight nor destruct other players for benefits
* clean up their rooms and sandboxes
* violent speech

###### Information
I'm pretty new to game scripting. By this project, I want to improve my skills about LUA and performant game scripting.  
There are tons of awesome Minetest mods out there. At first I'll do some research about them to investigate *best practices*. Perhaps I am be able to collect them in a nice Wiki.  
If I did something wrong or made some misspellings, you are pleased to correct me because I'm not a native english speaker.  
Have I made some mistakes about licensing? Inform me in person and not by a lawyer. I'll declare a correction and a mention as soon as possible.

## Features

## Future prospects
- [ ] SBS - Simple Biomes System
  To keep the game as simple as possible for children, there should be no hard to reach and overburden areas. 
- [ ] ECS - Emoticon Communication System
  If it is possible, there should be a emoticon system, which spawns smiley blocks over avatars head for some seconds. Maybe it's possible to avoid chats completely.
- NVS - Narrative Voice System
  All game information should presented by spoken word in the form of little narrative stories. Also information should explained by iconograpy suitable for children and some kind of full functional, animated in-game tutorials.
- [ ] HS - Housing System
  How to realize that? There should be an own server for that. LOTRO has a nice housing system...
  - [ ] Idea: Housing for players (shared locked area)
  - [ ] Idea: Sandbox for players (shared locked area)
- [ ] WAS - World Administration System
  - [ ] UAS - User Administration System
- [ ] CYS - Construction Yard System
  Construction Yard System means, that there should be a creators version of funTasia. Just for setting up the whole ~~pixel~~ voxel world.
- [ ] KS - Karma System
  He who seeks his own happiness by not oppressing others, who also desire to have happiness, will find happiness in his next existence. ~ [Dhammapada Verse 132](http://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/verseload.php?verse=131)
  
  What the player gives should happen to the player thrice. So there a karma system should be implemented.
  - [ ] Idea: Ecological behavior - deforest gives one negative karma point
  - [ ] Idea: Ecological behavior - reforest gives one positive karma point
  - [ ] Idea: Ecological behavior - burn things gives one negative karma point
  - [ ] Idea: Ecological behavior - use renewable resources gives one positive karma point
  - [ ] Idea: Social behavior - Spend meal to other player gives one positive karma point
  - [ ] Idea: Social behavior - Communicate bad emoticons gives one negative karma point
  - [ ] Idea: Order behavior - Clean up without using a clean up tool gives two positive karma points
  - [ ] Idea: Order behavior - Put recipe to foliant, folder or book gives one positive karma point
  - a. s. o.
